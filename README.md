# Automatic-Pothole-Filler

## Problem
In the span of 4 years (2018-2022), potholes have caused over 5000 deaths, in India. Uneven roads can cause a lot of damage to the vehicles, reduce the fuel efficiency and cause accidents in many ways. It is becoming too late before the Road and Transport Authority (RTA) takes any similar issue into consideration and take some initiation. At times, a hole might be ignored for long time, but it can cost lives in monsoon seasons (with filling up of water into it). This problem is in fact faced all over the world.

## Solution
The “Automated Pot-Hole Filler” is an automated bot that can recognize holes and fix them up the moment it detects one. The visuals are captured with a camera that scans a stretch of width of the road and detection can be done with the help of MachineLearning. Once there is a suspection of whether it is pothole, it goes to that spot and checks the bot with the help of installed IR sensors of what actually is the depth of hole and by moving the IR sensor, calculates the overall volume of how much tar has to be filled.
